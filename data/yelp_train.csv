"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.",0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).,0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.,0

The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.,0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.,0
Do not waste your money here!,0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.,0

"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.",0
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.,1
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0

Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.,0
I think not again,0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.,0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.,0
"Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch.",1
I was so insulted.,0
"Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.",0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
"Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.",0
I waited and waited.,0
"To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.",1

The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful.,1
Waiter was a jerk.,0
Everything was perfect the night we were in.,1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0

The service was poor and thats being nice.,0

"The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.",0
Spend your money elsewhere.,0

"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.",1
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.,0

This place is horrible and way overpriced.,0
Sooooo good!!,1
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.,1
The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing!,1

Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.,0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.,0

When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.,0

Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!,1
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.,0

They really want to make your experience a good one.,1
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.,1
"As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.",1
Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!,1
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.,1
Service is quick and friendly.,1

This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.,1
We enjoy their pizza and brunch.,1

The price is reasonable and the service is great.,1

"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.",1
Good prices.,1
Awesome selection of beer.,1
The only downside is the service.,0
Waitress was sweet and funny.,1
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.,0
"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.",0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,0
A great way to finish a great.,1

We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.,1
"Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.",0
Worst martini ever!,0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.,0
Bacon is hella salty.,1
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,0
"Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways.",1
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.,1
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.,1
When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.,1

Everything was good and tasty!,1
"Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(",0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.,1
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.,0
It was delicious!!!,1
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!,1
Once your food arrives it's meh.,0

I just wanted to leave.,0
There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.,1
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.,0
Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer.,1
We will not be coming back.,0
DELICIOUS!!,1
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.",0
"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.",0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.,0
The food was very good.,1

Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.,1
Those burgers were amazing.,1
It was pretty gross!,0

Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.,1
I've never been treated so bad.,0
Must have been an off night at this place.,0
"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!",1

Great pork sandwich.,1
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.,1
We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.,1

I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,1
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.,0
"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.",1
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.,0

will definitely be back!,1
The block was amazing.,1

I liked the patio and the service was outstanding.,1
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
"And the drinks are WEAK, people!",0
The selection of food was not the best.,0
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.,0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).,0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.,0
Great food and awesome service!,1

If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.,1
Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !,1
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.,0
"Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.",0
It's too bad the food is so damn generic.,0

Thoroughly disappointed!,0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!",0
Pretty cool I would say.,1
