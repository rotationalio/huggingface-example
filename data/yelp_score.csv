Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.,0
"It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.",0
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.,0
I did not expect this to be so good!,1
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,1
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!",1
Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.,1
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.",1
Weird vibe from owners.,0
I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.,1
"The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way.",1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.,0
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!,1
This place has it!,1
"Overall, I like this place a lot.",1
Don't do it!!!!,0
"i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!",1
Omelets are to die for!,1
"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.",1
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.,0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!,0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!,0
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!,1
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.,0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.,0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.,0
Food quality has been horrible.,0
We made the drive all the way from North Scottsdale... and I was not one bit disappointed!,1
By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!,1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.,0
It was equally awful.,0
"I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it's amazing what they do with eggplant!).",1
Everyone is treated equally special.,1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.,1
"I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.",0
Very disappointing!!!,0
Highly recommended.,1
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,0
A great touch.,1
"- Really, really good rice, all the time.",1
Will go back next trip out.,1
The service was extremely slow.,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.,0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.,0
"Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!",1
"I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!",0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.,0
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!,1
"There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better",0
I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.,1
The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!,1
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
"Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.",1
"REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.",0
(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.),1
Not good for the money.,0
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.,1
"A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.",1
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.",1
He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.,1
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.,1
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.,1
Would not recommend to others.,0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!,0
"The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.",0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.,0
They dropped more than the ball.,0
"Nice, spicy and tender.",1
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.,1
We'll never go again.,0
The food is very good for your typical bar food.,1
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.,0
"Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.",1
"Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.",0
The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.,1
"Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!",1
Tasted like dirt.,0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.,0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.,1
"After one bite, I was hooked.",1
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.,1
Great brunch spot.,1
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.",1
very slow at seating even with reservation.,0
The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.,1
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired.",0
this place is good.,1
This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.,1
"Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.",1
"I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.",0
Overpriced for what you are getting.,0
They were excellent.,1
"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.",1
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.,0
Go To Place for Gyros.,1
The real disappointment was our waiter.,0
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.,1
The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!,1
"I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.",0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it pur√©ed.,0
"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.",1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,1
"Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.",1
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.,0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.,0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",0
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.,1
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.,0
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.",1
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.",1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
"Seriously flavorful delights, folks.",1
I was VERY disappointed!!,0
"Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.",0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.,0
We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.,1
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.,1
This is a GREAT place to eat!,1
This place is disgusting!,0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.,0
"No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.",0
"After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.",0
I've had better atmosphere.,0
"Overall, a great experience.",1
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.",0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.,0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!,0
Always a great time at Dos Gringos!,1
The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.,1
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!",0
Great place fo take out or eat in.,1
"By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.",0
The ambiance was incredible.,1
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
Nothing special.,0
But I don't like it.,0
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.,1
Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.,1
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.,0
I'll definitely be in soon again.,1
Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!,1
AN HOUR... seriously?,0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.,1
As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!,1
Which are small and not worth the price.,0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.,0
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!,1
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.,0
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!,1
"Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.",0
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.",0
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.,0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
"Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.",0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.,0
Wow... Loved this place.,1
Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.,1
"Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.",1
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.,0
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.,1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.,0
The Macarons here are insanely good.,1
This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.,1
"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.",0
"I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.",1
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.,0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.,0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.,0
"This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.",1
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.,1
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.,1
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.,0
I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!,1
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.,0
"Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.",1
And service was super friendly.,1
Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.,1
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.",1
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.",0
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.,1
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.,0
"too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.",0
CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.,1
"Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.",1
"(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.",0
I LOVED it!,1
"If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.",1
Don't waste your time here.,0
"Love the margaritas, too!",1
"On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.",0
"I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!",1
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.,0
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre.",0
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.,1
No complaints!,1
"This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.",0
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless.",0
Very very fun chef.,1
"The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.",0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.,0
Owner's are really great people.!,1
Food was really boring.,0
The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.,1
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.,0
If you are reading this please don't go there.,0
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.,1
The staff are also very friendly and efficient.,1
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.,0
Hell no will I go back,0
"This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.",1
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.",0
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.,1
"If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.",0
"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.",1
We are so glad we found this place.,1
We won't be going back.,0
Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.,1
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!,0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.,0
"Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.",0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing,1
"The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.",0
Over rated.,0
I love this place.,1
Terrible management.,0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...,0
Food was below average.,0
"In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.",0
Reasonably priced also!,1
"Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.",1
Nargile - I think you are great.,1
"He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.",0
Worst Thai ever.,0
They know how to make them here.,1
It was probably dirt.,0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.,0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.,0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.,1
Left very frustrated.,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.,0
"If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.",0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
